Version 0.007
  * Updated copyright information only

April 23, 2016
Version 0.006
  * Squashed some remaining bugs by rewriting the file library
    functions to use File::Slurper instead of trying to set UTF8
    encodings on the file handles.

April 23, 2016
Version 0.004/0.005
  * Changes made should have no impact on actual functionality, just the
    ability to cleanly pass test suite
  * [Test suite] "use utf8" wasn't properly using UTF8 to read heredocs
    on Strawberry Perl (Windows).  Removed "use utf8"

April 10, 2016
  * [Test suite] Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurper (more compatible
    with UTF8)
